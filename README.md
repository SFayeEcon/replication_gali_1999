This project which concludes the course we took at Paris Dauphine PSL of Macro-Econometrics during the master's in quantitative economics first semester,
consisted in the theoretical and empirical results' replication of the famous 1999 Gali publication in the American Economic Review, using modern econometrics tools in Matlab.

### Data
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We used the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data for US measures of GDP, hours worked in nonagricultural establishments, employed population, stock of money, price (CPI) and interest rate (three-month Treasury bill rate). We used OECD quarterly data for measures of GDP and employed population for Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and Japan.
